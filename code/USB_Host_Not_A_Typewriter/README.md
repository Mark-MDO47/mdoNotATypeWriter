This code is derived from Adafruit Learning "Not A Typewriter". The original is here:

- Ruiz Brothers and Liz Clark

I am using the USB Host version of the code. In this version the keyboard connects to the Feather via a "host-mode" USB-A port and keystrokes are forwarded toe the "device-mode" USB-C port while also affecting the solenoids to give sound effects.
