This code is derived from Adafruit Learning "Not A Typewriter". The original is here:

- https://learn.adafruit.com/not-a-typewriter
- Ruiz Brothers and Liz Clark

I am using the USB Host version of the code. In this version the keyboard connects to the Feather via a "host-mode" USB-A port and keystrokes are forwarded toe the "device-mode" USB-C port while also affecting the solenoids to give sound effects.

The original Adafruit Learning code uses the MIT license, so I am allowed to modify it. I am not sure if I am required to provide Attribution to Adafruit and to Liz Clark but I am happy to do it!
