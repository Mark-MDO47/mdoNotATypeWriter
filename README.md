## License
[Top](#mdo-notatypewriter "Top")<br>
I am using the MIT license for this project since that is what Adafruit Learning uses.

There may be code included that I have modified from other open sources (such as Arduino, Espressif, SparkFun, Seeed Studio, DFRobot, RandomNerds, etc.). These other sources may possibly be licensed using a different license model. In such a case I will include some notation of this. Typically I will include verbatim the license in the included/modified source code, but alternatively there might be a LICENSE file in the source code area that points out exceptions to the MIT License.
