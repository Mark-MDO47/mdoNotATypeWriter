## Introduction
[Top](#mdo-notatypewriter "Top")<br>
The "Not A Typewriter" project was so great I had to make a copy for myself.<br>

Some parts were unavailable at this time and others I chose to do in a slightly different manner.
- The I2C Solenoid Driver https://www.adafruit.com/product/6318 was not available at the time I ordered
  - ... so I replaced it with a non-I2C version https://www.adafruit.com/product/970
  - I also chose to use some solenoids I had on hand
- The original project includes files for a beautiful 3D-printed typewriter/project-box
  - ... I chose to use a "dollhouse" typewriter https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B86HYR6P and some cardboard boxes and scrap I had on hand

## License
[Top](#mdo-notatypewriter "Top")<br>
I am using the MIT license for this project since that is what Adafruit Learning uses.

There may be code included that I have modified from other open sources (such as Arduino, Espressif, SparkFun, Seeed Studio, DFRobot, RandomNerds, etc.). These other sources may possibly be licensed using a different license model. In such a case I will include some notation of this. Typically I will include verbatim the license in the included/modified source code, but alternatively there might be a LICENSE file in the source code area that points out exceptions to the MIT License.
